General:
	Reft makes it easy to share files over a network. You can use any of
	the following methods
	* Reft protocol
	* HTTP protocol
	* FTP protocol
	* Streaming mp3 server

Reft Protocol:
	Machine A will be sending to Machine B.
	byte = 1 byte
	int = 4 bytes
	long = 8 bytes
	1. A sends B the number of files he wishes to send and total size
	of all the files
	<number of files : int> <size : long>

	2. B sends back 1 to accept transfer, 0 to not accept
	<yes or no : byte>

	# For each file A repeats steps 3-6
	3. A sends B the filename, a 1024 byte string. B should trim whitespace
	from the end of the string.
	<filename : 1024 bytes>

	4. A sends B the filetype, 1 for directory, 0 for file
	<type : int>

	5. If the type is file( 0 ) A sends B the size of the file
	<size : long>

	6. If the type is file( 0 ) A sends B the contents of the file
	<contents : size of file * byte>
